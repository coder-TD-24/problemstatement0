A simple C++ console calculator supporting basic operations (+, -, *, /), square roots, logarithms (ln, log10), exponentials, and powers (including fractional exponents). Uses built-in math functions for accuracy and handles basic input validation.
I have used cmath library for only fractional powers, while I have tried to do without using cmath library and have put an comment in it, not able to find my error in that.
